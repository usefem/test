<p>So youâ€™ve been writing your novel, investing blood, sweat, and tears into what you hope will take the market by storm. But have you got it right? Will your readers keep turning pages?</p>

<p>In <em>The Bestseller Code</em>, ex-publisher Jodie Archer and digital humanities professor Matthew Jockers explain why some books sell millions of copies. Why do we read what we read?

This book mixes groundbreaking text mining research and a deep love of contemporary novels to answer all these questions with engaging voice and fresh opinion. It will give you a new perspective on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, and how you might hit it.
